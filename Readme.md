# Halogen Model

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/green-mesa/hyperbone-model.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/green-mesa/hyperbone-model)

## tldr;

Nested [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) models with special support for [JSON HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html) and JSON Hypermedia Controls. 

## Installation

Because Halogen is written in modules, all the dependencies this module needs are installed with it. You do not need to include Backbone.js and Underscore.JS separately. Halogen Model actually makes use of a version of Backbone that has been refactored into separate components so that only the necessary parts are loaded. 

  Install with [npm(1)](http://npmjs.org):

    $ npm install --save hyperbone-model

## Tests

Clone the repo, do an npm install, install grunt-cli if you don't already have it then
```js
$ npm test
```

## Intro

  Default Backbone models are [Active Record](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern). You have a resource and you can do CRUD operations on it and that's great. "Getting your truth out of the DOM" is true and rich, complex client-side applications can be built.

  The problem is for REST Level 3 - Hypermedia documents - Backbone's simple CRUD model isn't enough. You load a resource, and that resource can have many related uris (For example a 'book' resource may contain a link to the related 'author' resource), it can have other resources embedded within it (e.g, our 'book' resource could have 'pages' embedded) and finally it could have hypermedia commands to interact with that resource __that do not point to the same uri as the original resource__. For example, our 'book' resource may have a command to add a page, and a page may have a command to delete itself from the book and so on.

  Rich REST level 3 Hypermedia APIs become, in effect, a complete expression of your application in their own right. 

  __Halogen__ extends Backbone to attempt to support HAL properly, to make building client-side applications consuming Hypermedia APIs as painless as possible. It's more opinionated than standard Backbone (out of necessity), but as this is a modular framework you only use the modules you need and that fit with the way you work.

  To this end, the roadmap for Halogen is as follows:

  - __Halogen Model__ : Nested Backbone models that support Hypermedia natively, supporting uri templates, rels, controls and embedded resources
  - __Halogen View__ : Binding Halogen Models to the DOM
  - __Halogen Resource__ : Halogen models with build in HTTP extensions for easy REST interactions
  - __Halogen Router__ : Sinatra/Express style routing for Halogen Applications

  
## WARNING!

  To remove the jQuery dependency and because Models in Halogen are not Active Records, the .sync() and .fetch() functionality has been stripped out. Changes to models are via commands, which are forms that are submitted to a server. HTTP interactions with a server need the Halogen Resource module which extends Halogen Model.

## Features

  - _links support, with 'self' mapped to `.url()`
  - Related links support with handy `.rels()` method
  - Curie support with fully qualified rel uri lookup for curied rels
  - support for uri templating to RFC6570, thanks to https://github.com/ericgj/uritemplate
  - automatic mapping of _embedded data to model attributes
  - True nesting, with support for dot notation access and ability to bind to events on nested attributes.
  - ability to assign custom Model prototypes for use with specific attributes with custom _prototypes attribute.
  - Special _commands keyword


## API

### Creating a model

Creating a hyperbone model. The minimum valid HAL document contains a _links object, but according to the spec is this optional, so you can create a hyperbone model instance with an empty object.

```javascript
  var Model = require('hyperbone-model').Model;

  var model = new Model({
    _links : {
      self : {
        href : "/helloworld"
      }
    }

  });

```

### .toJSON()

Backbone's toJSON method has had a bit of a facelift here so that the nested models and collections can be converted back to a straight JSON object.

Note that this is not the full or original hypermedia document, rather a JSON representation of the current attributes of the model.  

### .set( attr, data, options )

Usual Backbone .set(), but supports nesting of models and collections. This is handled automatically. To prevent this behaviour (to make it behave rather like generic Backbone) use `{noTraverse : true}` in options. 

Setting can be done via chaining of these models 

```javascript
// nested models means being able to bind to changes for nested models
m.get('thing').get('nestedthing').set("property", "hello")
```

or through dot notation

```javascript
m.set("thing.nestedthing.property", "hello");

//  internally this does... 
//  {
//    thing : {
//      nestedthing : { 
//        property : "hello"
//      }
//    }  
//  }
```

Support for dot notation means that you can't have attribute names with full stops. An additional option has been provided to deal with this:

```javascript
m.set("foo.bar.lol", "hello", { ignoreDotNotation: true });
// creates an attribute called "foo.bar.lol" in model m.

```

Preventing recursive traversal (i.e, for DOM elements or anything with cyclical references)

```javascript
  m.set("body", document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0], { noTraverse: true });
```

### .get( attr )

Halogen extends the .get() method to allow dot notation and indexed access notation to access these nested properties.

The dot notation feature is just basic string manipulation and recursive calls to .get(), and obviously you can always fall back to basic chaining if there's an issue - although reports of issues are welcome.

### More about using get and set...

The philosophy behind Halogen means resources are embeddable within resources which means it's models and collections all the way down. 

Automatic models... 

```javascript

  var model = new Model({
    _links : {
      self : {
        href : "/helloworld"
      }
    }

  });

  model.set("test", { name : "Test", value : "Testing"});

  // chaining...
  expect( model.get("test").get("name") ).to.equal("Test"); // TRUE

  // or use the handy dot notation. This works for deeply nested models, too.
  expect( model.get("test.name").to.equal("Test") ); // TRUE!

```

And automatic collections...

```javascript

  var model = new Model({
    _links : {
      self : {
        href : "/helloworld"
      }
    }

  });

  model.set("test", [{ name : "one"}, { name : "two"}, { name : "three"}]);

  expect( model.get("test").length ).to.equal( 3 ); // TRUE

  // using chaining...
  expect( model.get("test").at(0).get("name") ).to.equal("one"); // TRUE

  // or using dot notation and indexed access notiation...
  expect( model.get("test[0].name") ).to.equal("one"); // TRUE

  // arrays of objects automatically get all the power of Backbone collections... 
  model.get("test").each(function( item ){

    console.log(item.get("name"));

  });

  > one
  > two
  > three

```


In addition, events are triggered on the parent model when nested models are manipulated

```javascript

  model.on("change:test", function(){
 
    console.log("Test has been changed!")

  })

  model.get("test").set("name", "Not Test. Something else entirely");

  > Test has been changed!
```

If you want to use a specific model, the API is as follows:

```javascript

  var ModelForThings = Model.extend({
     defaults : {
        "bar" : "ren and stimpy"
     }
  });

  var ModelForResource = Model.extend({
    _prototypes : {
      "things" : ModelForThings
    }
  });

  var model = new ModelForResource({
    _links : { self : { href : "/test"} },
    "things" : {
      "foo" : "bar"
    }
  });

  // model.things is an instance of ModelForThings rather than a default empty model...
  expect( model.get("things").get("bar") ).to.equal( "ren and stimpy" ); // TRUE
```

This applies to _embedded and generic attributes.

The main difference between an model that comes from _embedded and one that's just inside the attributes is that _embedded models have a self.href

```javascript
  
  var m = new Model({
    _links : {
      self : {
        href : "/test"
      }
    },
    _embedded : {
      "foo" : {
        _links : {
          self : {
            href : "/foo/1"
          }
        }
        "bar" : "kbo"
      }
    }

  });

  expect( m.get("foo").url() ).to.equal("/foo/1"); // TRUE

  
```

### .url()

Shortcut to .rel('self');

```javascript
  var model = new Model({
    _links : {
      self : {
        href : "/helloworld"
      }
    }
  });

  expect( model.url() ).to.equal("/helloworld"); // TRUE
```

### .url( uri )

Set the _links.self.href value. Easier than new Model({ _links : { self : { href : "/some-uri"}}});

```
var model = new Model().url('/some-uri');
model.url(); // /some-uri
```

### .rel( rel [, data])

Get a link to another rel of the resource. If a particular rel is a URI template and `templated: true` is set, then rel
can be used to expand the uri template with the data. There is currently no way of discovering the requirements for a URI template - it's on the to-do list.

```javascript
  var model = new Model({
    _links : {
      self : {
        href : "/helloworld"
      },
      test : {
        href : "/test"
      },
      clever : {
        href : "/clever/{ id }",
        templated : true
      }
    }
  });

  expect( model.rel( "self" ) ).to.equal("/helloworld"); // TRUE
  expect( model.rel( "test" ) ).to.equal("/test"); // TRUE
  expect( model.rel( "clever", { id : "lol"} ) ).to.equal("/clever/lol"); // TRUE


```
### .rels()

Returns all the links. Hypermedia is about self discovery, after all. 

### .fullyQualifiedRel( rel )

Halogen supports curie (and `curies` with an array, incidentally), and offers a neato utility to recover the fully qualitied uri of a curied rel.

```javascript
  var model = new Model({
    _links : {
      self : {
        href : "/helloworld"
      },
      curie : {
        href : "http://www.helloworld.com/rels/{rel}",
        name : "rofl",
        templated : true
      },
      "rofl:test" : {
        href : "/test"
      }
    }
  });

  expect( model.rel( "rofl:test" ) ).to.equal("/test"); // TRUE
  expect( model.fullyQualitiedRel( "rofl:test" ) ).to.equal("http://www.helloworld.com/rels/test"); // TRUE
```

### .reinit( hypermedia )

Reinit is specific to Halogen Model. It returns all properties to any default values set in the model prototype and then merges in the newly loaded Hypermedia. Change events for issued for everything that's changed between the two versions. In a way this is more of an internal method to be used by Halogen Resource but if you're using jQuery or some other separate HTTP system then this is a much cleaner way of updating your local models.

```js
var MyModel = Model.extend({
  defaults : {
    'state' : 'initial'
  }
});

var model = new MyModel({
  'thing' : "some value!"
});

model.set('state', 'loaded');

model.reinit({
  'thing' : "Some other value!";
});

model.get('state', 'initial');
model.get('thing', 'Some other value!');
```

## Commands

Not part of the HAL Spec, but a crucial part of Halogen and the whole philosophy behind it. Model supports "Hypermedia Commands", using the reserved property `_commands`.

We won't go into too much detail here, but Commands represent HTTP interactions available to a resource. The simplest commands contain only what is necessary for a client to make a valid HTTP request, and the plan is the allow adding a schema to these so allow for validation/more useful form generation.

These commands could come from the server as part of the Hypermedia document you've loaded, or they can be defined in the model prototype with `defaults` and thus form a client side Hypermedia definition of the various HTTP interactions - or even just forms - that your application has. 

One nifty side effect of defining `_commands` in the model prototype is that it can either make Halogen work with non-Hypermedia APIs, or it can form the spec/definition of an as-yet non-existing API. You can build your client side application without even seeing an API then use the `_commands` and your dummy handlers to build an API spec. It's pretty cool. 

Halogen Model offers a method for getting at Commands in your model, and commands themselves have a few special methods built in.

Commands need a method, an href and some properties. The properties are just an object containing key-value pairs representing the form fields that the server expects to see in the submitted form. 

Here's an example of a HAL document with a `_command`.
```js
 {
  _links : {
    "cmds:create-new" : { // the internal rel for this control is "controls:create-new"
      href : "#_commands/create" // interal uro
    }
  },
  _commands : { // special _controls property
    create : {
      method : "POST",
      href : "/thing/create",
      encoding : "application/x-form-www-urlencoding",
      properties : {
        name : "Default name",
        description : "Default description",
        wantsThing : true
      }
    } 
  }
 }
```

### .command( [rel / id] )

Get the command model via rel or via dot notation.

```javascript
  model.command("cmds:create-new");
 // ===
  model.command("create");
```

The convention is that an internal rel to a command can begin `#commands` or `#_commands` or `#command` and then the path to the specific command is separated by a slash. 

## Command / Parent Model synchronisation

It's quite a common usecase that a command's data is actually related to data in the parent model.

```js
model.get('Username'); // "Terry Wogan"
model.command('edit-user').properties().get('Username'); // "Terry Wogan"
```

Halogen Model offers a method to automatically detect these and then keep them automatically synchronised. In a way this behaviour emulates the classic Backbone developer experience, where you bind a view to your model, manipulate just that model and then, when you're wanting to persist something you execute a command (which handily has any changes made to the parent model reflected in it automatically).

To use Command/Model sync, do:

```js
var synchronisedModel = new Model({ syncCommands : true });
```

When you first create a model or when you .reinit() the model, it will key value pairs in the model that match key value pairs in the commands. The keys and values have to be identical for automatic sync to be performed. 

### .getCommandProperty( property )

```js
model.command('command-name').properties().get('property-name');
// or...
model.getCommandProperty('command-name.property-name');
```

### .setCommandProperty( property )

```js
model.command('command-name').properties().set('property-name', "Hello world");
// or... 
model.setCommandProperty('command-name.property-name', "Hello world");
```

## Command API

After accessing a command, e.g., 
```js
var command = model.command('cmds:create-new');
```

You get...

### .properties()

Access the nested properties model.

```js
var properties = command.properties();
properties.get('name'); 
// "Default name"
```
This is a shortcut for
```js
command.get('properties.name')
// "Default name"
```

### .property(property)

Shortcut to .properties().get(property)

### .pull()

Any properties in the command that exist in the parent model are copied to the command.

```js
model.set('name', 'No longer the default');
command.pull();
command.properties().get('name')
// "No longer the default"
```

### .push()

All the properties in the command are pushed into the parent model.

```js
command.push();
model.get('name');
// "Default name"
```

### About push and pull more generally

In the Halogen world, when you want to gather data from a user, you can bind a particular input to a particular model attribute like you would with Backbone. And that's fine. 

But Halogen adds the ability to bind entire forms to Commands. These commands may need seralising and sending to a server, or maybe they'll just be dealt with by your own application. Doesn't really matter. They're just commands, operations that will change your resource in some way, either locally or remotely.

But Commands don't interact with the parent model by default. They're isolated. The reason the .push() and .pull() methods exist is so that you can slowly build up your model using various commands, pushing their properties into your model and then have another command pull all the data it needs from the model ready for submitting to the server. 

### .pushTo( command )

Commands can push their properties directly to other Commands. This only copies properties that exist in the target command though.

### .pullFrom( command )

Commands can also pull properties from another command, but it only pulls properties that exist inside itself.
